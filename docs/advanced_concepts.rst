Advanced concepts
=================

Routed and unrouted tasks (task forking)
----------------------------------------

During its lifetime, the task will transfer between various states and its reference will be passed through several queues, a simple way to understand it is to see how the tasks state changes in various moments:

.. image:: task-lifetime.svg

Each new task is registered in the system by a call to :py:meth:`karton.Producer.send_task` and starts its life in the **unrouted task queue** with a ``TaskState.Declared`` state.

All actual task data is stored in the ``Karton.task`` namespace and all other (routed and unrouted) queues will be always only holding a reference to a record from this place.

The main broker - ``karton.System`` constantly looks over the unrouted (``karton.tasks``) queue and keeps the tasks running as well as clears up leftover unneeded data.

Because task headers can be accepted by more than one consumer the task has to be forked before it goes to the appropriate **consumer (routed) queues**. Based on **unrouted task**, ``Karton.System`` generates as many **routed tasks** as there are matching queues. These tasks are separate, independent instances, so they have different **uid** than original unrouted task.

.. note::
    
    While **uid** of routed and unrouted tasks are different, **parent_uid** stays the same. **parent_uid** always identifies the routed task.

    Reference to the unrouted task is called **orig_uid**.

Each registered consumer monitors its (routed) queue and performs analysis on all tasks that appear there. As soon as the consumer starts working on a given task, it sends a signal to the broker to mark the tasks state as ``TaskState.Started``.

If everything goes smoothly, the consumer finishes the tasks and sends a similar signal, this time marking the task as ``TaskState.Finished``. If there is a problem and an exception is thrown within the ``self.process`` function, ``TaskState.Crashed`` is used instead.

As a part of its housekeeping, ``Karton.System`` removes all ``TaskState.Finished`` tasks immediately and ``TaskState.Crashed`` tasks after a certain grace period to allow for inspection and optional retry.


Task tree (analysis) and task life cycle
----------------------------------------

Every analysis starts from **initial task** spawned by :class:`karton.Producer`. **Initial task** is consumed by consumers, which then produce next tasks for further processing. These various tasks originating from initial task can be grouped together into a **task tree**, representing the analysis.

.. image:: forking-task.svg

Each task is identified by a tuple of four identifiers:

- **uid** - unique task identifier
- **parent_uid** - identifier of task that spawned current task as a result of processing
- **root_uid** - task tree identifier (analysis identifier, derived from uid of initial **unrouted** task)
- **orig_uid** - identifier of the original task that was forked to create this task (unrouted task or retried crashed task)

In order to better understand how those identifiers are inherited and passed between tasks take a look at the following example:

.. image:: task-tree.svg



Handling logging
----------------
By default, all systems inheriting from :py:meth:`karton.core.KartonBase` will have a custom :py:meth:`logging.Logger` instance exposed as :py:meth:`log`. It publishes all logged messages to a special PUBSUB key on the central Redis database.

In order to store the logs into a persistent storage like Splunk or Rsyslog you have to implement a service that will consume the log entries and send them to the final database, for an example of such service see :ref:`example-consuming-logs`.

The logging level can be configured using the standard karton config and setting ``level`` in the ``logging`` section to appropriate level like :code:`"DEBUG"`, :code:`"INFO"` or :code:`"ERROR"`.


Consumer queue persistence
--------------------------

Consumer queue is created on the first registration of consumer and it gets new tasks even if all consumer instances are offline. It guarantees that analysis will complete even after short downtime of part of subsystems. Unfortunately, it also blocks completion of the analysis when we connect a Karton Service which is currently developed or temporary.

We can turn off queue persistence using the :code:`persistent = False` attribute in the Karton subsystem class.

.. code-block:: python

    class TemporaryConsumer(Karton):
        identity = "karton.temporary-consumer"
        filters = ...
        persistent = False

        def process(self, task: Task) -> None:
            ...

This is also the (hacky) way to remove persistent queue from the system. Just launch empty consumer with identity you want to remove, wait until all tasks will be consumed and shut down the consumer.

.. code-block:: python

    from karton.core import Karton

    class DeleteThisConsumer(Karton):
        identity = "karton.identity-to-be-removed"
        filters = {}
        persistent = False

        def process(self, task: Task) -> None:
            pass

    DeleteThisConsumer().loop()

Prioritized tasks
-----------------

Karton allows to set priority for task tree: :attr:`TaskPriority.HIGH`, :attr:`TaskPriority.NORMAL` (default) or :attr:`TaskPriority.LOW`. Priority is determined by producer spawning an initial task.

.. code-block:: python

    producer = Producer()
    task = Task(
        headers=...,
        priority=TaskPriority.HIGH
    )
    producer.send_task(task)

All tasks within the same task tree have the same priority, which is derived from the priority of initial task. If consumer will try to set different priority for spawned tasks, new priority settings will be simply ignored.

Extending configuration
-----------------------

During processing we may need to fetch data from external service or use libraries that need to be pre-configured. The simplest approach is to use separate configuration file, but this is a bit messy.

Karton configuration is represented by special object :class:`karton.Config`, which can be explicitly provided as an argument to the Karton constructor. `Config` is based on :class:`configparser.ConfigParser`, so we can extend it with additional sections for custom configuration.

For example, if we need to communicate with MWDB, we can make MWDB binding available via :code:`self.config.mwdb`

.. code-block:: python

    import mwdblib

    class MWDBConfig(Config):
        def __init__(self, path=None) -> None:
            super().__init__(path)
            self.mwdb_config = dict(self.config.items("mwdb"))

        def mwdb(self) -> mwdblib.MWDB:
            api_key=self.mwdb_config.get("api_key")
            api_url=self.mwdb_config.get("api_url", mwdblib.api.API_URL)

            mwdb = mwdblib.MWDB(api_key=api_key, api_url=api_url)
            if not api_key:
                mwdb.login(
                    self.mwdb_config["username"],
                    self.mwdb_config["password"])
            return mwdb

    class GenericUnpacker(Karton):
        ...

        def process(self, task: Task) -> None:
            file_hash = task.get_payload("file_hash")
            sample = self.config.mwdb().query_file(file_hash)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        GenericUnpacker(MWDBConfig()).loop()

and provide additional section in `karton.ini` file:

.. code-block::

   [s3]
   secret_key = <redacted>
   access_key = <redacted>
   address = http://127.0.0.1:9000
   bucket = karton

   [redis]
   host = 127.0.0.1
   port = 6379

   [mwdb]
   api_url = http://127.0.0.1:5000/api
   api_key = <redacted>

Karton-wide and instance-wide configuration
```````````````````````````````````````````

By default the configuration is searched in the following locations (by searching order):

- :code:`/etc/karton/karton.ini`
- :code:`~/.config/karton/karton.ini`
- :code:`./karton.ini`
- environment variables

Each next level overrides and merges with the values loaded from the previous path. It means that we can provide karton-wide configuration and specialized instance-wide extended configuration specific for subsystem.

Contents of :code:`/etc/karton/karton.ini`:

.. code-block::

   [s3]
   secret_key = <redacted>
   access_key = <redacted>
   address = http://127.0.0.1:9000
   bucket = karton

   [redis]
   host = 127.0.0.1
   port = 6379

and specialized configuration in the working directory :code:`./karton.ini`

.. code-block::

   [mwdb]
   api_url = http://127.0.0.1:5000/api
   api_key = <redacted>

Passing tasks to the external queue
-----------------------------------

Karton can be used to delegate tasks to separate queues e.g. external sandbox. External sandboxes usually have their own concurrency and queueing mechanisms, so Karton subsystem needs to:

- dispatch task to the external service
- wait until service ends processing
- fetch results and spawn result tasks keeping the `root_uid` and `parent_uid`

We tried to solve this using asynchronous tasks but it turned out to be very hard to be implemented correctly and didn't really fit in to with the Karton model.

Busy waiting
````````````
The simplest way to do that is to perform all of these actions synchronously, inside the :meth:`process` method.

.. code-block:: python
    
    def process(self, task: Task) -> None:
        sample = task.get_resource("sample")
        
        # Dispatch task, getting the analysis_id
        with sample.download_temporary_file() as f:
            analysis_id = sandbox.push_file(f)
        
        # Wait until analysis finish
        while sandbox.is_finished(analysis_id):
            # Check every 5 seconds
            time.sleep(5)

        # If analysis has been finished: get the results and process them
        analysis = sandbox.get_results(analysis_id)
        self.process_results(analysis)


Karton debug mode
-----------------

During your karton services development endeavours you'll often have the urge to test them out on the production environment.

While this is totally fine, you have to be careful not to disrupt the production services by consuming the tasks meant for them. In most cases you also don't want to propagate logs from your experiments to the production log pipeline.

Karton debug mode was crafted especially for this purpose. It adds a random suffix to the service identity to create a new, non-conflicting task queue.
It also permanently sets the consumer persistence to False and disables log forwarding.

You can enable it by setting:
- :code:`KARTON_KARTON_DEBUG` environment value to "1"
- :code:`debug` parameter to `1` in the :code:`[karton]` config section
- :code:`--debug` command-line parameter


Negated filter patterns
-----------------------

.. versionadded:: 5.5.0

There is one more pattern syntax, not documented in the :code:`Filter Patterns` section anymore.
It is possible to define a negated filter, and they are handled in a special way. For example let's consider following filters:

.. code-block:: python

    # Special ("old style") negation
    [
        {"foo": "bar", "platform": "!linux"},
        {"foo": "bar", "platform": "!windows"},
    ]

Depending on how you think this should work, this may have a surprising behavior. In particular this is **not** equivalent to:

.. code-block:: python

    # Regular ("new style") negation (this is intentionally WRONG, see below)
    [
        {"foo": "bar", "platform": {"$not": "linux"}},
        {"foo": "bar", "platform": {"$not": "windows"}},
    ]

That's because negated "old style" filters are handled in a very special way, but :code:`$not` is not. Let's use the following task as an example:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "foo": "bar",
        "platform": "linux"
    }

Recall that filters are checked top to bottom, and if at least one pattern matches, the task will be accepted by a consumer.
Using regular ("new style") patterns, the matching will proceed as follows:

- Check against the first filter: :code:`foo` matches, but the filter explicitly rejects tasks with :code:`platform: linux`. 
- Check against the second filter: :code:`foo` matches, and the platform - :code:`linux` - is not equal to to :code:`windows`, so the task is accepted.

Whoops! This is probably not what the programmer intended. In comparison, "old style" filters will always reject a task if it matches at least one negated filter.
This sounds nice, but as every special case may cause unpleasant surprised. This is especially true when combining "old style" and "new style" patterns.
That's why it's currently recommended to only use "new style" filters - they do everything "old style" filters can, and much more.

In this case, the proper way to get the desired behavior with "new-style" filters is:

.. code-block:: python

    # Regular ("new style") negation
    [
        {
            "foo": "bar",
            "platform": {"$not": {"$or": ["linux", "windows"]}},,
        }
    ]

It's a bit more verbose, but at least it should be very clear what is happening: We want :code:`foo` equal to :code:`bar`, and :code:`platform` **not** equal to either :code:`windows` or :code:`linux`.
In this case there are no special cases, and matching checks every filter top to bottom independently, as usual.

.. warning::

    "Old style" negations are only supported at the top-level! Combining them with "new style" filters will not work. Exclamation mark is not considered a special character in this case.

    In fact, we're not even sure how :code:`{"$or": ["!windows", "!linux"]}` *should* behave.

.. note::
    
    Since "new style" patterns were introduced in Karton version 5.5.0, "old style" negations are not recommended and should be considered deprecated.

    Nevertheless, Karton still supports them and they will keep working indefinitely. So don't worry, there are no breaking changes here.
