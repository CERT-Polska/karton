Headers, payloads and resources
=================================

Task consists of two elements: **headers** and **payload**. 

Task headers
------------

Headers specify the purpose of a task and determine how task will be routed by karton-system. They're defined by flat collection of keys and values.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    task = Task(
        headers = {
            "type": "sample",
            "kind": "runnable",
            "platform": "win32",
            "extension": "dll"
        }
    )

Consumers are listening for specific set of headers, which is defined by `filters`.


.. code-block:: python

    class GenericUnpacker(Karton):
        """
        Performs sample unpacking
        """
        identity = "karton.generic-unpacker"
        filters = [
            {
                "type": "sample",
                "kind": "runnable"
            },
            {
                "type": "sample",
                "kind": "script",
                "platform": "win32"
            }
        ]

        def process(self):
            # Get incoming task headers
            headers = self.current_task.headers
            self.log.info("Got %s sample from %s", headers["kind"], headers["origin"])

If Karton find that task matches any of subsets defined by consumer queue filters: task will be routed to that queue.
Following the convention proposed in examples above, it means that `GenericUnpacker` will get all tasks that apply to samples directly runnable in sandbox (regardless of target platform) or Windows 32-bit only scripts.

Headers can be used to process our input differently, depending on the kind of sample:

.. code-block:: python

    class GenericUnpacker(Karton):
        ...

        def process(self):
            # Get incoming task headers
            headers = self.current_task.headers
            if headers["kind"] == "runnable":
                self.process_runnable()
            elif headers["kind"] == "script":
                self.process_script()

Few headers have special meaning and are added automatically by Karton to incoming/outgoing tasks.

- :code:`{"origin": "<identity>"}` specifies the identity of task sender. It can be used for listening for tasks incoming only from predefined identity.
- :code:`{"receiver": "<identity>"}` is added by Karton when task is routed to the consumer queue. On the receiver side, value is always equal to :code:`self.identity`

Task payload
------------

Payload is also a dictionary, but it's not required to be a flat structure like headers are. Its contents does not affect the routing so task semantics must be defined by headers.

.. code-block:: python

    task = Task(
        headers = ...,
        payload = {
            "entrypoints": [
                "_ExampleFunction@12"
            ],
            "matched_rules": {
                ...
            },
            "sample": Resource("original_name.dll", path="uploads/original_name.dll")
        }
    )

Payload can be accessed by Consumer using :py:meth:`Task.get_payload` method.

.. code-block:: python

    class Kartonik(Karton):
        ...
        def process(self):
            entrypoints = self.current_task.get_payload("entrypoints", default=[])

But payload dictionary itself still must be **lightweight and JSON-encodable**, because it's stored in Redis along with the whole task definition. 

If task operates on binary blob or complex structure, which is probably the most common use-case, payload can still be used to store the reference to that object. The only requirement is that object must be placed in separate, shared storage, available for both Producer and Consumer. That's exactly how :class:`Resource` objects work.

Resource objects
----------------

Resources are part of a payload that represent a reference to the file or other binary large object. All objects of that kind are stored in `Minio <https://github.com/minio/minio>`_, which is used as shared object storage between Karton subsystems.

.. code-block:: python

    task = Task(
        headers = ...,
        payload = {
            "sample": Resource("original_name.dll", path="uploads/original_name.dll")
        }
    )

Resource objects created by producer (:class:`LocalResource`) are uploaded to Minio and transformed to :class:`RemoteResource` objects.
RemoteResource is lazy object that allows to download the object contents via :py:attr:`RemoteResource.content` property.


.. code-block:: python

    class GenericUnpacker(Karton):
        ...

        def unpack(self, packed_content: bytes) -> bytes:
            ...

        def process(self):
            # Get sample resource
            sample = self.current_task.get_resource("sample")
            # Do the job
            unpacked = self.unpack(sample.content)
            # Publish the results
            task = Task(
                headers={
                    "type": "sample",
                    "kind": "unpacked"
                },
                payload={
                    "sample": Resource("unpacked", content=unpacked)
                }
            )
            self.send_task(task)

If expected resource is too big for in-memory processing or we want to launch external tools that need the file system path, resource contents can be downloaded using :py:meth:`RemoteResource.download_to_file` or :py:meth:`RemoteResource.download_temporary_file`.

.. code-block:: python

    class Kartonik(Karton):
        ...
        def process(self):
            archive = self.current_task.get_resource("archive")
            with archive.download_temporary_file() as f:
                # f is file-like named object
                archive_path = f.name

If you want to pass original sample along with new task, you can just put a reference back into its payload.

.. code-block:: python

    task = Task(
        headers={
            "type": "sample",
            "kind": "unpacked"
        },
        payload={
            "sample": Resource("unpacked", content=unpacked),
            "parent": sample  # Reference to original (packed) sample
        }
    )
    self.send_task(task)

Each resource has its own metadata store where we can provide additional information about file e.g. SHA-256 checksum

.. code-block:: python
    
    sample = Resource("sample.exe", 
                      content=sample_content,
                      metadata={
                        "sha256": hashlib.sha256(sample_content).hexdigest()
                      })

More information about resources can be found in API documentation.

Directory resource objects
--------------------------

Resource objects work well for single files, but sometimes we need to deal with bunch of artifacts e.g. process memory dumps from dynamic analysis. Very common way to do that is to pack them into Zip archive using Python `zipfile module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html>`_ facilities.

Karton library includes specialized Resource class for that kind of archives, called :class:`DirectoryResource`.

.. code-block:: python

    task = Task(
        headers={
            "type": "analysis"
        },
        payload={
            "dumps": DirectoryResource(analysis_id, 
                                       directory_path=f"analyses/{analysis_id}/dumps"),
        }
    )
    self.send_task(task)

Files contained in `directory_path` are stored under relative paths to the provided directory path. Default compression level is `zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED` instead of `zipfile.ZIP_STORED`.

Directory resources are deserialized on the consumer side to the :class:`RemoteDirectoryResource` objects that are specialized version of :class:`RemoteResource` and contain additional methods, allowing us to extract Zip to the temporary folder.

.. code-block:: python

    class Kartonik(Karton):
        ...
        def process(self):
            dumps = self.current_task.get_resource("dumps")
            with dumps.extract_temporary() as dumps_path:
                ...

If we don't want to extract all files, we can work directly with :class:`zipfile.ZipFile` object, which will be internally downloaded from Minio to the temporary file using :py:meth:`RemoteResource.download_temporary_file` method internally.

.. code-block:: python

    class Kartonik(Karton):
        ...
        def process(self):
            dumps = self.current_task.get_resource("dumps")

            with dumps.zip_file() as zipf:
                with zipf.open("sample_info.txt") as info:
                    ...

More information about resources can be found in API documentation.

Persistent payload
------------------

Part of payload that is propagated to the whole task subtree. The common use-case is to keep information related not with single artifact but the whole analysis, so they're available everywhere even if not explicitly passed by the Kartonik.

.. code-block:: python

    task = Task(
        headers=...,
        payload=...,
        payload_persistent={
            "uploader": "psrok1"
        }
    )

Incoming persistent payload (task received by Kartonik) is merged by Karton library with the outgoing tasks (result tasks sent by Kartonik). Kartonik can't overwrite or delete the incoming payload keys. 

.. code-block:: python

    class Kartonik(Karton):
        ...
        def process(self):
            uploader = self.current_task.get_payload("uploader")

            assert self.current_task.is_payload_persistent("uploader")

            task = Task(
                headers=...,
                payload=...
            )
            # Outgoing task also contains "uploader" key
            self.send_task(task)

Regular payloads and persistent payload keys have common namespace so persistent payload can't be overwritten by regular payload as well e.g.

.. code-block:: python

    task = Task(
        headers=...,
        payload={
            "common_key": "<this will be ignored>"
        },
        payload_persistent={
            "common_key": "<and this value will be used>"
        }
    )

.. warning::

    Because merging strategy is quite aggressive, it's not recommended to overuse that feature. They should be treated as "analysis-wide payload". It's recommended to set them only in initial task.
    
    Don't store any references to resources or other heavy objects here, unless you need to. Persistent payload is, as the name says, persistent, so it is propagated to the whole task subtree and **can't be removed** during analysis. Resource referenced by persistent payload won't be garbage-collected until the whole analysis (task subtree) ends, even if it's not needed by further analysis steps.
