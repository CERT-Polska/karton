Welcome to Karton's documentation!
==================================
Karton is a library made for analysis backend orchestration.
Allows you to build flexible malware analysis pipelines and attach new Karton Services with ease.

This is achieved by combining powers of a few existing solutions, karton just glues them together and allows you to have some sane amount of abstraction over them.

Karton ecosystem consists of:

- `Redis <https://www.redis.io/>`_ - store used for message exchange between Karton subsystems

- `MinIO <https://github.com/minio/minio>`_ - temporary object storage compatible with Amazon S3 API, holds all the heavy objects (aka Resources) like samples, analyses or dumps.


Task routing and data exchange is achieved with the help of **Karton-System** - core of the Karton, which routes the tasks and keeps everything in order (task lifecycle, garbage collection etc.)

   from karton.core import Karton, Task, Resource

   class GenericUnpacker(Karton):
       """
       Performs sample unpacking
       """

       filters = [
           {

           }
       ]

       def process(self, task: Task) -> None:
           # Get sample object
           packed_sample = task.get_resource('sample')
           # Log with self.log
           self.log.info(f"Hi {packed_sample.name}, let me analyze you!")
           ...
           # Send our results for further processing or reporting
           task = Task(

                  "sample": Resource(filename, unpacked)
               })
